I'm a Software Engineer from India, currently living in Berlin, Germany.
I've been working as a professional programmer since 2015.

I work on compilers and programming languages as a hobby.

Check out [Hades](https://github.com/dhruvrajvanshi/hades-lang), which
is my own programming language on which I've been working on since
2020.

I'm experienced in backend and frontend development.

## The tech I'm most familiar with

* Typescript/Javascript (Worked on React and Angular apps in 4 companies)
* Java (I've worked with Java/Spring at 3 companies)
* Kotlin (Hades is written in Kotlin)
